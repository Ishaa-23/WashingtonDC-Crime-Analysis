# Introduction
This project leverages Power BI and Python to analyze crime patterns in Washington, D.C. using historical crime data. The goal is to uncover insights into crime trends, resolution times, and precinct performance, enabling data-driven decision-making for law enforcement and policymakers.
# Key Features:
* 📊 Dynamic Crime Analysis: Interactive dashboards in Power BI visualize crime distribution by offense type, precinct, and time of day.
* 📈 Time to Solve Cases: Measures the average resolution time for different crimes, identifying delays and efficiency gaps.
* 🏛 Precinct Performance: Ranks precincts based on case resolution time and crime severity.
* 🔍 Top Crime Areas: Identifies high-crime PSAs and voting precincts, applying Top N filtering dynamically.
* 🐍 Python Integration: Utilizes Python scripts for advanced data cleaning, statistical modeling, and anomaly detection.
# Technologies Used:
* Power BI – Interactive reports, DAX calculations, and data modeling.
* Python  – Data preprocessing, visualization, and deep analysis.
* DAX Measures – Custom ranking, dynamic parameters, and performance metrics.
